The coding contest is now closed. We received a total of 119 submissions (109 Java, 8 Scala, 1 JRuby, 1 Xtend). Thanks everyone for your participation and enthusiasm.
You can read our explanation around the SortedMap problem at [http://kijijiblog.ca/coding-contest-closed](http://kijijiblog.ca/coding-contest-closed)


So you think you can code, eh?
==============================

The [Kijiji](http://www.kijiji.ca) Development Team has a great challenge for you.

Armed with your JVM language of choice, your mission is to find out the most profitable streets of Toronto in terms of
parking tickets (profitable for the city that is).

On its open data portal, the City of Toronto published the complete list of
[Parking tickets distributed in 2012](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=ca20256c54ea4310VgnVCM1000003dd60f89RCRD)

Take a look at their explanation spreadsheet to understand the format of their data.

- Check-out this project
- Download the 2012 data and extract it into src/test/resources
- Make the test case pass
- Run 'mvn package' to create an archive target/kijiji-coding-contest.tar containing your pom.xml and src/main
- Send this archive by e-mail to coding-contest@kijiji.ca before July 31st, 2013 at 11:59pm

You can add any library you want to the pom.xml but don't modify the test class.

Getting your dream job
======================

Kijiji is constantly recruiting talented developers in Toronto.

If you think that a fast paced, fun, quirky company with a startup culture would be a good fit for you, seize the
opportunity when you have the attention of the developers, and attach your resume to your email submission. This is not
mandatory, and will have no effect on the contest results – but could have a very dramatic one on your career. Kijiji
is a top 10 website in Canada, and a property of eBay, Inc., so the sky is the limit on advancement opportunities for
those with talent and drive.
